### Hey there! I'm Mady. 👋

I'm a web developer and instructor with over a decade of experience in the field. I absolutely love teaching and mentoring students, and my passion for web development is contagious! Whether I'm leading a group class or providing one-on-one coaching, I strive to create a fun and supportive learning environment that encourages creativity and experimentation.

When I'm not in the classroom, you can usually find me outdoors with my furry friends. I'm a proud dog mom and love spending time with my pups, whether we're hiking through the mountains or just lounging in the sun. I also love to travel. There's nothing quite like the thrill of exploring new places and immersing myself in different cultures.
